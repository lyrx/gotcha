# Pyramids! The Tutorial #

## The Environment ##

This is an *SPA*, a *single page application*, which means that
there is only one single [HTML-Page](src/main/webapp/index.html)
loaded inside the browser. After loading the Javascript
embedded inside the page, 
any dynamic content and all application 
controls are generated  by Javascript.

The app runs **inside the browser**. So there is no server backend, except
gateways giving access to p2p networks like IPFS or Stellar.

As there is only JavaScript on the client side, it will be very
easy to integrate the app into all sorts of already existing web content.
There is no need to port or duplicate a complete infrastructure to 
a new location. It should just be enough to load existing Javascript modules
into a new HTML page and integrate it with the existing HTML.
