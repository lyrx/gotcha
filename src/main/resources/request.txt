Feature request: Provide a URL that has an IPFS hash as parameter.
It opens directly your upload page ("Pin by Hash") and prefills
the text field for the hash with the value from the hash.
So any application using IPFS hashes could directly link
to your page for pinning. Wouldn't that be a nice way to
get new customers? (It would help me, of course, because I could use that link)
  Of course, any application could also use your
API to trigger the upload, but that would be more integration work
that needed to be done. A link would be so much easier to use.
