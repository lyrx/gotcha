# What Is Inside The Pyramids?  #

## Generate Credentials ##

Normally, to use any site in the internet, you have to select a username and invent a new password. You end up with
a lot of usernames and passwords,  for each site a different one.

There are already solutions to simplify this task. For
example, most browsers store usernames and passwords
for you. (Google's Chrome Browser  does that
pretty well.) And there are many password managers ready to be used.

Whatever solution you select, you
always have to trust the company or institution providing you the solution. Sometimes these parties are not so trustworthy!

This is where P2P networks come in! These networks
eliminate  central institutions, replacing them
by transparent programatic communication rules (or protocols) between  computers (peers). The rules have been worked
out in the open. Many people from different locations
and nationalities have collaborated. Often these
people do not work for money. There motivation is just idealism
or enthusiasm.

So users no longer need to trust in companies (like banks).
They trust the rules governing P2P computer networks. These
rules can not easily be changed by humans, once established.
Somehow you are replacing humans by machines: You
trust machines instead of humans, because you consider them to be
more reliable.

That is how Bitcoins work: You are sending something that you
consider to be money from A to B, and now bank is involved in
the transaction. But there are many money more use cases for
this basic idea then just sending money.

It is very difficult, to come
up with a better solution.
